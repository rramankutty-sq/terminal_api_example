# A basic implementation of Square's Terminal API Beta

Use this example code and live example to base your own application on.

Here, we implement a full example of running Terminal API.

To run on your local machine - 
1) Clone this repository
2) Fill .env and fill with relevant information - should look like the following:
```
export APPLICATION_ID=<YOUR_APP_ID_HERE
export SECRET=<YOUR_APP_SECRET_HERE>
export ENCRYPT_KEY=<UNIQUE_UNGUESSABLE_STRING_HERE>
```
3) Run ```source .env``` to properly instantiate the environment variables to your local environment
4) Navigate to the chosen port (probably localhost:3000) and begin your local Terminal API adventure!
